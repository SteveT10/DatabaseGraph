## About

This is one of my personal projects working with GUIs and Web Scrapping. This project uses a C++ GUI to communicate with Python
and Database files to create a program that can web scrape data off the Internet, store data into a non-volatile form of memory, and retrieve
said data to display in a graph.

## Building

For building the project, please build using the CMakeLists.txt file and ensure that a version of both wxWidgets and CMake exists on your system..
Additionally, please install Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
